# US-Accidents-Analysis

## Introduction
This is a exploratory data analysis project on US Accidents. The project is to analyse and understand the factors that are responsibe for the accidents and to derive insights to answer crucial questions on traffic behaviour, environmental factors and accident hotspot locations.
